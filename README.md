# e-Enroll

e-enroll uses puppeteer to webscape online courses from Udemy, Coursera, MIT, and EDX.  
Upon the user's query, a function executes puppeteer to navigate to those 4 websites and scrapes courses based off of their query.  Shortly afterwards the courses are displayed for the user! 

#The guts of the webscraping function can be found in the file course-scraper.js in the root directory
